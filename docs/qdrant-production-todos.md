## Notes

### Model Selection Criteria

When selecting an embedding model, consider:

1. **Quality**: Benchmark on your domain (legal docs? code? general text?)
2. **Latency**: GPU vs CPU, batch size, sequence length
3. **Cost**: OpenAI charges per token, open-source models are free
4. **Licensing**: Some models restrict commercial use
5. **Vector Size**: Smaller = faster search, larger = better quality

**Recommended Starting Point**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Vector size: 384
- Quality: Good for general text
- Speed: Fast (even on CPU)
- License: Apache 2.0 (commercial use OK)

### Qdrant Scaling Considerations

**When to scale**:
- **Vertical**: Add more RAM/CPU when search latency increases
- **Horizontal**: Shard collection when vector count > 10M

**Monitoring metrics**:
- Vector count per collection
- Search latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Upsert throughput
- Memory usage

**Scaling strategy**:
1. Start with single Qdrant instance
2. Scale vertically to 16GB RAM, 4 CPU
3. Add replicas for read scaling
4. Shard collections for write scaling
